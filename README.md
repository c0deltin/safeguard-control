# Safeguard-Control

This repository contains the code and deployment of AWS components like 
Lambdas, S3 Bucket, SNS topic and SQS queue.

## To-Do's
- [ ] upgrade AWS SDK to V2.

## Issues
Currently, it is not possible to deploy the SNS topic via CloudFormation / SAM.   
So it's created manually.
SAM GitHub issue: [github.com/aws/serverless-application-model/issues/2259](https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model/issues/2259).
